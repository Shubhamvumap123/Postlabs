## 2025-05-22 - Context-Aware Empty States
**Learning:** Generic empty states (e.g., "No tasks") fail to clarify whether the system is truly empty or if the current view/filter yields no results.
**Action:** Always implement dynamic empty states that reflect the active tab or filter (e.g., "No scheduled tasks", "No tasks found matching your filters"). This provides immediate feedback on system state.
